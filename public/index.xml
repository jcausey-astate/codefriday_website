      <description>{previous|topics} Below is a list of topics that have been discussed in previous {code|friday} meetings. This list is meant to provide inspiration for anyone wishing to do a presentation, but unsure of what kinds of topics are welcomed. It is OK to present new versions of things that are already on the &amp;ldquo;previous topics&amp;rdquo; list&amp;mdash;especially if the topic was last discussed in a previous semester.

      <description>Projector The projector will accept HDMI input from an external source (such as a laptop). We have adapters to many common display interfaces including DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, and VGA.
The projector also works with the Document Camera and the room&amp;rsquo;s desktop PC (see below). You can switch between all three inputs.
Document Camera The room has a document camera that can be used for displaying written (paper) material, we well as hardware projects.</description>
