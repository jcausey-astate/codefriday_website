### Projector
The projector will accept HDMI input from an external source (such as a laptop).  We have adapters to many common display interfaces including DisplayPort, Mini DisplayPort, and VGA.

The projector also works with the Document Camera and the room's desktop PC (see below).  You can switch between all three inputs.

### Document Camera
The room has a document camera that can be used for displaying written (paper) material, we well as hardware projects.  The camera is capable of zooming and panning, and it is very flexible.  You could use it to project a close-up of a robot's servo motor, for example.

### Desktop Computer
The room has a desktop computer running _Microsoft Windows 10&copy;_.  The computer has USB input, a CD-ROM drive, and audio input/output available.  It ties in directly to the projector, and can be projected in a mirrored interface or as a second screen.

#### Software
The computer in the room has the following third-party software installed:

* Microsoft Office (including PowerPoint)
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* ActiveState Komodo Edit
* MobaXTerm
* WinSCP
* Mozilla FireFox
* Google Chrome
* Command-line compiler:  `g++`

Additionally, you can run portable applications from a USB flash drive.

### Networking
The room has good Wifi availability (_AstateAnywhere_ and _AstateSecure_ networks).  Applications requiring any networking other than web browsing (ports 80 and 223) will need to be connected through _AstateSecure_, which requires a university login.

Wired (Ethernet) networking is also available upon request (please contact us in advance to make arrangements).

### Touch-Interface Whiteboard
The room is equipped with a touch-enabled projection whiteboard.  The main projector projects on this board as a screen, and the software for controlling it is installed on the room's desktop PC.
