Although there are no strict "rules" about what you must do during a `{code|friday}` presentation (other than the 7-minute time limit), the following tips can make your presentation more successful and memorable:

* **Be prepared to use the technology.**     
The tools and technology available in the classroom is listed [here](/tools-available "Technology available in the presentation room.").  It would be a good idea to take a look at the list and make sure to use the technology to its maximum potential.
    * Typing, compiling, and running code "live" is _good_, but it can be _slow_ if you aren't well prepared.  Practice "live coding" in advance.
    * Slides are a good way to show "code snippets" and present information about them&mdash;it is easier to make good use of your time this way.
    * Be sure you have prepared your presentation in a way that is compatible with the technology in the room.  If you aren't sure whether the presentation you have planned will work, email <tt>jcausey (at) astate.edu</tt> for more information.
* **Rehearse!**     
Be sure that you know _what_ you want to say and _how_ you want to say it.  Seven minutes is not much time to cover a technical topic like source code; a little preparation will make all the difference.
* **Answer questions as best you can.**     
After your presentation, the audience will be allowed to ask questions.  Be prepared for some silly questions, but also for some very tough ones.  It is OK if you don't know the answers&mdash;this isn't a test!   Remember to reward good questions with tokens.  Keep your feedback for "not-so-good" questions as positive as possible... Remember that the audience is here to learn from you; people of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge will be present, everyone's feedback should be equally welcomed.
* **Have fun!**    
Remember, this is a casual "brown-bag session", not a class meeting.  Positive humor is appreciated&mdash;you are among friends, so have fun with it.
