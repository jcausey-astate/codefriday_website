## Challenge 7: ZigZag Code Golf

This challenge consists of consists of producing a repeating &ldquo;Zig-Zag&rdquo; pattern on the console screen while keeping the program as short as possible.<br>
**Paradigm:** _Structured Programming_<br>
**Difficulty Level:** _Beginner_

Write a program to creates a zig-zag or "triangle wave" pattern vertically on stdout.  Your program should produce 5 of these "waves" with an amplitude (max height) of 10.  

For reference, two waves of amplitude 10 are shown.

### Code Golf

One you have the program working, try every trick to make it as short as possible.  The program containing the fewest characters (bytes) that correctly solves the problem wins!
