<h4><strong><tt>{previous|topics}</tt></strong></h4>

Below is a list of topics that have been discussed in previous `{code|friday}` meetings.  This list is meant to provide inspiration for anyone wishing to do a presentation, but unsure of what kinds of topics are welcomed.  It is OK to present new versions of things that are already on the "previous topics" list&mdash;especially if the topic was last discussed in a previous semester.  You might also want to check out the [tips and recommendations for a good presentation here](/presentation-tips "Hints for a good presentation.").
